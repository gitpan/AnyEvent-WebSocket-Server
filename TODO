Please open an issue on Github if you want me to finish these TODO
items soon.

- Add support for TLS/SSL. In fact section 10.6 in RFC 6455 states
  "WebSocket implementations MUST support TLS".

- Add "timeout" feature. The timeout is set between the TCP connection
  establishment and the complete of receiving WebSocket request. The
  timeout is the defence against the slow-request attack. However that
  kind of feature should be covered by the front-end Web server like
  Apache httpd or nginx, so it's not very important for this module.
